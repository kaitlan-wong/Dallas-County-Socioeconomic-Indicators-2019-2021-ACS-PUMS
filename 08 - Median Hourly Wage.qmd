#### See <https://walker-data.com/census-r/analyzing-census-microdata.html> for guidance on using tidycensus to get ACS PUMS

Get 2021 ACS PUMS data.

```{r}
# Get ACS data
pums21 <- get_pums(
  variables = c("AGEP", "RAC1P", "HISP", "PUMA", "WKHP", "WAGP", "ESR", "WKWN"),
  state = "TX",
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2021,
  recode = TRUE,
)

# View data
head(pums21)
```

Filter for Dallas PUMAs and mutate variables

```{r}
# Filter for Dallas PUMAs and working-age adults
data21 <- pums21 %>%
  filter(PUMA %in% c("02304", "02305", "02306", "02307", "02309", "02310", "02311", "02312", "02313", "02314", "02315", "02316", "02319", "01901", "02001"),
         AGEP >= 25 & AGEP <= 64,
         # employed adults
         ESR %in% c(1,2,4,5)) %>%
  # recode race/ethnicity

      ) %>%
  # calculate hourly wage
  mutate(

Create table of counts and %s using person weight variable.

```{r}
library(matrixStats)

Repeat steps for 2019 data.
